# Magic Word Quest 🐍

This is a simple Python console game where the player has to guess the magic word within a limited number of attempts.

## How it works
- The game chooses a magic word.
- The user receives a hint: the first letter and the length of the word.
- The user has 3 attempts to guess the word.
- If the user guesses correctly, they win.
- If the user does not guess in 3 attempts, the correct word is displayed.

## Example:
Welcome to Magic Word Quest!
Hint: The word has 5 letters and starts with 'd'.
Enter your guess: hope
Incorrect. Try again.
Attempts left: 2
Enter your guess: love
Incorrect. Try again.
Attempts left: 1
Enter your guess: dream
Congratulations! You guessed the magic word! 🎉
